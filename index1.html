          <h2>Dear Sir/Madam</h2>
          <p>
            I am studying at Samdach Preah Moha Sangkha Reach Bour kri
            University. I have been met with many study experiences; one of them
            is work with group assignment and some time by individual which
            trained me how to manage and solve the problem within the group
            assignment. Especially, work in group had provided me good
            relationship, unity and confidences in the member group that I got
            understand the way to get successfulness.
          </p>
          <p>
            Moreover, I am familiar with computer office skills and some
            marketing program which I think that they will push our work forward
            without any obstacle. I am highly communicated internally and
            externally, I am working hard and under pressure.
          </p>
          <p>
            I strongly expected that you would give me an opportunity to talk to
            you personally at your convenience. My telephone number is... I am
            anxiously looking forward to hearing from and being interview by
            you.
